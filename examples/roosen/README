This is an example of the way your "monogram" program
should work. 

To run the program. enter
	./roosen

Note that it is usually not desirable to include 
"binary" files in git repositories, only text files.

Note: if your Pi just keeps showing a scrolling IP#, you need to turn off
the program that shows the IP. To do that, press "down" on the joystick
(towards the USB ports) three times.
