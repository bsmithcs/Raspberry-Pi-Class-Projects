Run this program on your Pi using:
    ./clockdisplay

Then enter a series of lines of the form hh:mm:ss (hours,
minutes, seconds) to see them each displayed
successively. Press "^D" (control-D) to exit the program
(or enter an invalid time value like "a").

Note: You can also use, for example, "echo 11:12:17 | ./clock"
to see a single time.
